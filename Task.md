# Homework assignment
## Situation
Paysera allows private and business clients to `deposit` and `withdraw` funds to and from Paysera accounts in multiple currencies. Clients may be charged a commission fee.

You have to create an application that handles operations provided in CSV format and calculates a commission fee based on defined rules.

## Commission fee calculation
- Commission fee is always calculated in the currency of the operation. For example, if you `withdraw` or `deposit` in US dollars then commission fee is also in US dollars.
- Commission fees are rounded up to currency's decimal places. For example, `0.023 EUR` should be rounded up to `0.03 EUR`.

### Deposit rule
All deposits are charged 0.03% of deposit amount.

### Withdraw rules
There are different calculation rules for `withdraw` of `private` and `business` clients.

**Private Clients**
- Commission fee - 0.3% from withdrawn amount.
- 1000.00 EUR for a week (from Monday to Sunday) is free of charge. Only for the first 3 withdraw operations per a week. 4th and the following operations are calculated by using the rule above (0.3%). If total free of charge amount is exceeded them commission is calculated only for the exceeded amount (i.e. up to 1000.00 EUR no commission fee is applied).

For the second rule you will need to convert operation amount if it's not in Euros. Please use rates provided by [https://api.exchangeratesapi.io/latest](https://api.exchangeratesapi.io/latest).


**Business Clients**
- Commission fee - 0.5% from withdrawn amount.

## Input data
Operations are given in a CSV file. In each line of the file the following data is provided:
1. operation date in format `Y-m-d`
2. user's identificator, number
3. user's type, one of `private` or `business`
4. operation type, one of `deposit` or `withdraw`
5. operation amount (for example `2.12` or `3`)
6. operation currency, one of `EUR`, `USD`, `JPY`

## Expected result
Output of calculated commission fees for each operation.

In each output line only final calculated commission fee for a specific operation must be provided without currency.

# Requirements
1. Third party frameworks, libraries, dependencies, tools are **not required** but **allowed**.
    1. PSR-4 is required. We require the use of `composer` for autoloading even if you do not use any external dependencies;
    2. If your application is not based on framework skeleton, your project must use [this skeleton](https://github.com/paysera/skeleton-commission-task/archive/master.zip) as a bootstrap.
    3. Avoid including framework or any dependencies into your task if you don't actually use them;
2. Your application must be maintainable:
    1. Dependencies between separate parts of your code should be clear;
    2. Code should be consistent, readable, structured(with a clear flow);
3. Application **must** have **one** automation test that takes the provided input in the task, processes it and checks the output.
4. Your application must be extensible:
    1. Adding new functionality or changing existing one should not require rewriting the system itself or it's core parts;
    2. Code structure should not depend on current concrete configuration. For example, adding new currency should not require changing code itself, like adding new methods or extending switch cases etc.
5. Code must be PSR-12 compatible;
6. A minimal documentation should be provided:
    1. How system should be run (what command to run);
    2. How to initiate system's tests (what command to run);
    3. Short description of functionality in more difficult places could be provided in the code itself;
7. Do not use external infrastructure dependencies, like MySQL databases or temporary files - just make the calculations in memory;
8. Do not use Paysera name in titles, descriptions or the code itself. This helps others to find the libraries that are really related to our services and/or are developed and maintained by our team.

# Evaluation Criteria
1. Requirements considered as met by Paysera development team. It would be best if all requirements are met;
2. Code quality - readability, structure, maintainability, extensibility, testability;
3. Speed of the system can also be considered, but is not as important as other criteria.

# Task Submission

Before submitting your task, please review the requirements once again – **all of them must be accomplished**.

You can upload the source (i.e. to GitHub) publicly, but **please refrain from using Paysera name** in title, description or source code.

Submit the task in your chosen format (link to versioned code in GitHub/Google Drive or code in zip file, etc.) by sending it to the email provided by Paysera HR Coordinator or your Agency. Please also include approx. how much time was spent to complete the task.
